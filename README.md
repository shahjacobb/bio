Hi! I'm a computer science student at Queens College, graduating in 2025, now seeking my first software engineering role.

I most recently interned at [Pharmesol AI](https://www.pharmesol.com/), building out their backend API using [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) and integrating LLM Voice Agents using [Retell AI](https://www.retellai.com/). 

I'm now most interested in backend engineering, with a focus on observability, containerization, and distributed systems.

### What I'm building right now:

* [**YFinance Market Data Observability Platform**](https://github.com/shahjacobb/Market-Data-API-Observability-Platform) - An observability platform that tracks API latency, errors, and traces for the Yahoo Finance API. Built with OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, and Grafana, running in Docker containers.

### Technical Skills
- **Languages:** Python, JavaScript, C++, Java
- **Frameworks/Services:** React, NextJS, FastAPI, Flask, AWS Amplify, OpenAI API
- **Databases:** AWS DynamoDB, MySQL
- **Tools & Platforms:** Docker and Docker Compose, AWS S3, Prometheus, OpenTelemetry, Grafana
