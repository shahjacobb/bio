Hi! I'm a computer science student at Queens College, graduating in 2025, now seeking my first software engineering role. Check out my personal site [here](https://shahjacob.netlify.app/) for my portfolio work/resume.

I most recently interned at [Pharmesol AI](https://www.pharmesol.com/) as a full-stack engineering intern, helping building out their backend API using [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) and integrating LLM Voice Agents using [Retell AI](https://www.retellai.com/). I also built customer dashboards in React using [Tremor.js](https://tremor.so/).

I'm now most interested in backend engineering, with a focus on observability, containerization, and distributed systems.

### What I'm building right now:

* [**YFinance Market Data Observability Platform**](https://github.com/shahjacobb/Market-Data-API-Observability-Platform) - An observability platform that tracks API latency, errors, and traces for the Yahoo Finance API. Built with OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, and Grafana, running in Docker containers.
