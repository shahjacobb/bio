Hi! I'm a computer science student at Queens College, graduating in 2025, now seeking my first software engineering role.

I most recently interned at [Pharmesol AI](https://www.pharmesol.com/), building out their backend API using [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) and integrating LLM Voice Agents using [Retell AI](https://www.retellai.com/). 

I’m now most interested in backend engineering, with a focus on building distributed systems, internal tooling, and observability. My recent project includes developing telemetry pipelines with Prometheus, containerizing services using Docker, and leveraging Grafana for monitoring and visualizing system performance and reliability.

I’m looking to apply my experiences in full-stack development and growing knowledge of backend/infra to work on interesting technical problems and work closely with engineering teams in enterprises/startups to build software. 

### What I'm building right now:

* [**Market Data API Observability Platform**](https://github.com/shahjacobb/Market-Data-API-Observability-Platform) - an observability platform for monitoring real-time market data APIs using OpenTelemetry and Prometheus instrumentation and  and Grafana for visualization. Runs on Docker containers.

### Technical Skills
- **Languages:** Python, JavaScript, C++, Java
- **Frameworks/Services:** React, NextJS, FastAPI, Flask, AWS Amplify, OpenAI API
- **Databases:** AWS DynamoDB, MySQL
- **Tools & Platforms:** Docker and Docker Compose, AWS S3, Prometheus, OpenTelemetry, Grafana
